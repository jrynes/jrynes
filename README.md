### Presentations

* **Dynamo, Python, and Git - A Tale of Two Weeks | Spring 2020**
  * Collaborating through GitLab across Virginia, teams from the Roanoke and Arlington offices of AECOM developed a solution to update furniture family parameters. A handful of hours of coding collaboration saved two team members from manually updating parameters for two weeks each, and pushed some unique ideas about IronPython GUI elements in a Dynamo script.
